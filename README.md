# ChemCalc
a pretty basic Object Oriented project. I create a list of elements. I want to add some math equations in for stuff like unit analysis, electrostatic charges, etc. 

## Building
Dependencies
- java(built with openjdk11 but older versions could work)
- some version of make(it works with GNU and BSD make)

Just cd into the ChemCalc folder and run 'make run' to build and run the project
